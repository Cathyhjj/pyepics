Installation instructions for Py-Epics3
=======================================

To install the epics module from source, use 

   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install


This assumes that Python 2.5 or higher is installed, and that the shared
object libraries for Epics Channel Access (libCom.so and libca.so) can be
found on your system.  For Windows32, these dlls (Com.dll and ca.dll) are
included with this distribution and installed for you.

I've only tested the installation and use on Linux and Win32.

Locating CA shared libraries
============================

On Unix systems, the shared libraries for Epics Channel Access (libca.so,
libCom.so) must be found by Python at runtime.  Since Epics installations
generally leaves these in an architecture-specific location (and not
"installed" into normal library directories), you will probably need to set
this up once per machine.  There are a few ways to do this:

  1. set the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH)
     to point to the directory with the shared object libraries:

       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/epics/base/lib/linux-x86 

       setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/epics/base/lib/linux-x86 

  2. (Linux only?): add the directory with the shared object library as a
    line in the file /etc/ld.so.conf (or in a file that is included by it) 
    and run /sbin/ldconfig  (as root):

     sudo echo '/usr/local/epics/base/lib/linux-x86' > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/epics.conf
     sudo /sbin/ldconfig


Option 1. would need to be for user (any shell, really) that wanted to use
CA, and so should probably be put in a shsll startup script.  

Option 2. only needs to be done once for the whole system.
