This module provides Python access to the EPICS Channnel Access (CA)
protocol.  This library uses ctypes to wrap the basic CA functionality and
provides a higher level interface that encapsulates an EPICS Process
Variable (PV) as a class.

This is under active development and the implementation is incomplete.
