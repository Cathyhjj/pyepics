      PyEpics3:  Epics Channel Access for Python,  Version 3.0.6</font>
</b><p>

PyEpics3 is a Python interface for <a href='http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics'>Epics</a>
<a href='http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-14/11-docs/CAref.html'> Channel Access</a>
This interface is meant to replace older Python interfaces to Channel Access, especially
<a href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~newville/Epics/Python/">EpicsCA</a> (version 2).

<p> The PyEpics3 package includes both low-level (C-like) and high-level
  (Python objects) access to the EPICS Channnel Access (CA) protocol.  

PyEpics3 uses Python's ctypes library to wrap the basic CA functionality,
and builds higher level objects on top of that basic interface.  Using
ctypes has several advantages, including no need for extension code written
in C, better thread-safety, and easier installation on multiple platforms.
It also allows for easier porting from the Python 2 series to Python 3.

<hr><p> <b>Status</b>: <br> PyEpics3.0.6 is ready to use.  As with all
software, there may be some bugs or missing features, and more testing and
documentation are desirable.  Better compatibility with other existing
Epics-Python interfaces is also desirable.

<hr><p><b> Prerequisites:</b>
  To use PyEpics3, you'll need:

 <ol><li> <b>Python2.5 or higher</b>.
     The package has been tested with Python 2.5, 2.6, and Python 3.1.  Tests pass for all
     of these, though more testing is needed for Python3.

     <li> <b>EPICS 3.14  base</b>.  I believe that Epics 3.14.8 or higher may be needed.
	 All the testing done so far has been with 3.14.11. Specifically, the
	 shared libraries libCom.so and libca.so (or Com.dll and ca.dll on Windows) from
	 Epics base are required.  <br> For Unix-like systems, these are assumed to be
	 available (that is, can be found by Python at runtime). <br>For Windows,
	 pre-built DLLs are included and installed so that no other Epics installation is
	 required.
