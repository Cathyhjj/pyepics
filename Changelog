	* Version 3.0.2:

	- improved method to "locate CA dll" (or .so or .dylib) at run
	time, using ctypes.util.find_lib().  On Unix (including linux, Mac
	OSX), if the "usual system approach" of finding a DLL is not
	successful, the enviroment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and
	DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OSX) will be searched for the appropriate
	DLL.
		
	- improved functionality for Python Threads.   The _cache data in
	ca.py now stores Channel IDs with CA "context", so that use of
	Python threads (as from threading.Thread) work, allowing, gets(),
	puts(), and callbacks in separately running threads.
