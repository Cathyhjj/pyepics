These programs demonstrate some uses of the epics module, especially when 
coupled with wxWidget displays.

== Motor_Display.py:
This provides a simple GUI interface to Epics Motors. Multiple motors can
be specified.  These will be shown as rows in the main page, much like an
MEDM screen, only nicer.  Each motor will be fully connected to the Epics
PVs of the Epics Motor Record.  A ``more`` button will bring up a separate
window with more details of the Motor Record.

   ~> python Motor_Display.py XXX:m1 XXX:m2 XXX:m3

This program requires the wxPython package.

== AreaDetector_Display.py
This will connect to and display the image from an Epics Area Detector.
The display will be live, responding to changes in the Epics record.

   ~> python AreaDetector_Display.py XXXAD1:image1:

This program requires the wxPython package and the Python Imaging Library

== caget.py
This is a simple emulation of the the caget command.
   
   ~> python caget.py  XXX.VAL
