Epics Instruments
============================

Epics Instruments is a GUI Application for managing and controlling
operator-defined Instruments of the `Epics Control System
<http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/>`_.  It provides a simple way for end-users
to group together low-level Epics Parameters into an Instrument, and
save and reproduce settings of these Instruments.   In this way, it
provides an easy way to switch back and forth between configurations of
Epics devices.
