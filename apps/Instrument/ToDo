Epics Instrument To Do list:

Add / Edit Instrument Page (Frame)
   change instrument name
   add/remove pv -- how to manage connection, type determination??
    
Setting Page:
   remove instruments?
   fonts, colors?

Move more GUI settings (instrument hide, instrument order) to Info table

Building InstrumentConfigure Page:
   a wx.Timer might be helpful here too:
   user types a PV name.  On return / loose focus the PV goes from unknown
   to unconnected.  On connection, the decision of type (motor, enum,
   string, float, int) is made
