Epics Instrument To Do list:

Add / Edit Instrument Page (Frame)
   change instrument name
   add/remove pv -- how to manage connection, type determination??
    
Adding/Managing PVs per Instrument:
   a wx.Timer might be helpful here too:
   user types a PV name.  On return / loose focus the PV goes 
   from unknown to unconnected.  On connection, the decision of 
   type (motor, enum, string, float, int) is presented.

Setting Page:
   remove instruments

Move more GUI settings (instrument hide, instrument order) to Info table

Add simple Epics DB, and watch these variables (if supplied and connected) 
so that one can use Epics CA to move an Instrument to a named Position.
